# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.  
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what's best for the community  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
